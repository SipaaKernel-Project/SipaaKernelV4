### Working on real hardware!
This is weird to see a Cosmos OS running on real hardware.

Here is a proof

### Audio support
Yes, now SipaaKernel supports audio with the ICH AC97 system! (in wave file)

### A better canvas (not SipaVGA)
This version of SipaaKernel uses the @terminal-cs VBE canvas!

### And more in the SipaaKernel oficial page!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!
This version of SipaaKernel is in a pre-alpha state.

Yes, it is running on real hardware, but DON'T USE IT AS YOUR MAIN OS, unless you want your PC to be a useless expensive box.

## Requeriments

You need the COSMOS DevKit and Visual Studio 2022 with Extensions Workload
