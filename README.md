A new version of SipaaKernel, better!

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

This is weird to see a Cosmos OS running on real hardware.

### Audio support
Yes, SipaaKernel supports now the audio! (in wave file)

### A better canvas (not SipaVGA sorry)
This version of SipaaKernel uses the @terminal-cs VBE canvas!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
This version of SipaaKernel is in a pre-alpha state.

OK, it is running on real hardware, but DON'T USE IT AS YOUR MAIN OS.
